## Spirals
### Hack with P5.js - GHW Oct 2022

⚠️ **Please be aware that Spirals contains a rotating geometric pattern of bright colors** 

Spirals is a small code-to-art project made with [P5.js](https://p5js.org) for [Global Hack Week's](https://ghw.mlh.io/oct) hack with P5.js challenge. 

It's transformations were adapted from this [excellent P5.js guide](https://genekogan.com/code/p5js-transformations/)—check out the rotational symmetry section.


The color palette was found [here.](https://coolors.co/palette/ffadad-ffd6a5-fdffb6-caffbf-9bf6ff-a0c4ff-bdb2ff-ffc6ff-fffffc)

#### Setup
To setup and view this project in the browser I used the p5.vscode and Live Server VSCode extensions. For alternatives, see the P5.js [Get Started](https://p5js.org/get-started/) guide.
